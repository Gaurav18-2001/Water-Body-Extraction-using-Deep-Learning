# Water-Body-Extraction-using-Deep-Learning

Water body extraction is still confronted with a long-standing challenge in removingvariousshadows (including shadows of mountains, buildings and clouds, etc.) and eliminatingnoisewithin water. To figure out that, proposed a model for water body extraction.There are regional limitations in ancient strategies of water body extraction. for various terrain, allthe methods believe heavily on rigorously hand-engineered feature choice and enormous amountsofprevious knowledge. because of the issue and highcost in acquiring, the tagged informationof remotesensing is comparatively small. Thus, there exist some challenges within the classificationof hugequantity of high dimension remote sensing data. Deep Learning encompasses a sensible capabilityofhierarchic feature learning from unlabeled data. Stacked distributed autoencoder (SSAE), onedeeplearning method, is wide investigated for image recognition.Therefore the proposed model wastestedon three different terrains,i.e, desert, urban and hilly areas.
